## Backstory & Motivation

The business is founded by 37-year-old William Mac Tavish.  
Growing up in the tough industrial streets of Glasgow, William learned fast that getting ahead wasn’t just about hard work—it was about knowing people, reading the room, and making the right moves at the right time. He could handle himself with the shipyard workers during the day, and by night he’d be in a clean coat at the gambling tables, sharing drinks and stories with the wealthy. His smooth talk got him out of trouble more than once, and his knack for closing a deal earned him respect on both sides of the class line.  

After years of the same grind, he wanted more. He saw an opportunity in tobacco—a trade that connects everyone. Workers light up after a long day, gamblers take a slow draw between hands, lawmen enjoy a smoke on a quiet watch, and the wealthy take pride in a fine cigar. It’s something everyone understands.  

William’s plan is simple: bring the best tobacco to Blackwater. Hand-rolled cigarettes for the traveler who needs a quick smoke, premium cigars for those who like to take their time, fine chewing tobacco for the ranch hands and the outlaws, and special blends made to order for the loyal and the important.  

For him, it’s not just a shop—it’s a place to build a name, meet people, and leave something behind that lasts. A business built on quality, fairness, and knowing exactly what the customer needs, no matter who they are.

## Poster

I have designed a poster that fits the style of a tobacco store in Blackwater. This is a prototype/concept of what I would put on the pinboards.

## Operations Supply Chain

I’ve made connections and an agreement with **Gallows Creek Ranch**, owned by Isabella McGraw, to grow tobacco and gather whatever supplies are needed to keep the store running. With the ranch’s ranch-hands and resources, I can make sure there’s always a steady supply coming in, so production won’t slow down.  

### Supply Chain

- **Farming:** Grow tobacco 
- **Production:** Process and roll tobacco and woodcutting. 
- **Distribution:** Sell directly to  saloons, and through traveling salesmen.  

### Staffing

- **Owner / Manager:** William Mac Tavish   
- **Sales Representatives:** Shopkeepers who handle customer sales.  
	I tend to hire 1-5 people to work at the tobacco store. 
-  **Farmhands:** Can be hired or recruited if needed. 

### Pricing *(RP Economy-Driven)*

- **Cigarettes:** $2 each  
- **Cigars:** $8 each

## Budget and Investment

To get the tobacco store up and running, with the equipment and stock, I’ll need to take out a loan. I understand the responsibility that comes with it and I am willing to work hard to pay it off before the deadline. 

### Estimated Expenses

- Ownership
-  Tobacco supplies
	- Tobacco seeds
	- Other ingredients for custom. 
- Tobacco Process Tooling - every 6 days
	- Scissors
	- Axe
	- Saw
	- Watering can
- Staff payment

### Contingency
If sales slow, I will scale down production temporarily, focus more on bulk deliveries to partners, and take on additional work to ensure repayments continue without delay.

## Closing word

Blackwater Tobacco Road isn’t just a shop—it’s a place where people from all walks of life can find something they enjoy, a moment to pause, and a taste of quality they can trust. I’m here to build more than a business; I’m here to create a name that stands for fairness, skill, and a good product.

With steady work, careful planning, and an eye for what the customer wants, I’m ready to make Blackwater Tobacco Road a part of this town that people remember long after their time here.
